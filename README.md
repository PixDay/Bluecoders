# Bluecoders

This app is using Back/ and Front/ folders; (the newBack folder isn't working in every machine I don't know why. You can take a look at it I think it's really better than the Back/ folder).

Backend is using a mongodb database using docker, so you can start the docker using `docker-compose up -d`. You can then install the node packages with `npm i` and run the nodejs server with `npm run start` or `npm run dev`if you want to make changes (it's using nodemon to refresh automatically the changes you do).

Front is using VueJs you have to install packages with `npm i` then start the front using : `npm run serve`
